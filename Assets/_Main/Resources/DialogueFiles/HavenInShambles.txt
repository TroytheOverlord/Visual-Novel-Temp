Narrator "You see a sign on the door saying the store is going out of business"

??? "Hm yea that makes sense, you can just stream everything these days. Hey isn't that where Kate's Karaoke used to be, oh looks like they replaced it with a new Moondollars, man people sure can't get enough coffee can they"
