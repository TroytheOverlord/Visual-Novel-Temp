Scarlet "Watch yourself Brown you ain’t the only one and the name's not Red it’s Scarlet now watch out I’m not in the mood"

??? "Heh I see, you too then, ....wait did you seriously just call me Brown really was that the best you could come up with"

Scarlet "Well my fault for not being able to properly insult you I’m about to be late for cla…."

Narrator "Before you can even finish that thought the second bell rings"

Scarlet "ss well there goes that, since I’m already late now I guess I could entertain you….Brown"

??? "Alright I get it my bad Scarlet I was kinda pissed off but that doesn’t mean I should take it out on someone uninvolved and the name's Sable not Brown"

Scarlet "Thank you, and sorry something ticked me off early on top of running late for class, so I was already running a short fuse, but I shouldn’t have lashed out at you"

Sable "Hey don’t sweat it, your lashing out helped get my head on straight after dealing with a mess of my own, plus you got spunk you didn't let me walk all over you I like that"

Sable "Anyway I catch you later since we're both gonna be in detention afterschool so see you then Scar maybe we can trade stories"

Scarlet "wait what do you mean…..crap I forgot we get detention for tardiness, damn it well nothing I do about that now, anyway Sable huh she's strange but oddly enough I find her directness pretty interesting now then let’s get to class"
