??? "HOLY SHIT where I am, actually who am I, WAIT I DON'T REMEMBER MY NAME"

Enter your name 

Troy "Oh yea my name is Troy now that that's been settled where the hell am I"

Narrator "You look around and find yourself in a room and suddenly your hit with a wave of nostalgia"

Troy "Wait a second this is my old room, how'd I get here I moved outta here years ago"

Narrator "A chill runs down your spine as you recall your supposed final moments, you quickly lift up your shirt to view your now intact body"

Troy "Wait wait wait hold on didn't I die, it's all so vivid the pain, the blood, the sense of dread I couldn't have imagined all that and yet here I am alive and well standing in my old room how can th-"

Narrator "As you make your way towards the voice you pass a mirror and stumble in disbelief after witnessing what was reflected back at you"

Narrator "Once again your thoughts are interrupted, this time by the door being flung open and a stern yet familiar face is standing in front of you. Before you can even react you feel a tear roll down your face"

Narrator "And you find yourself rushing into the arms of the woman standing in front of you"

Troy "*sobbing* MOM is that really you I thought I'd never see you again. I was so scared I didn't know what to do I thought I'd die alone in that wreckage"

Mom "What the heck are you talking about you've been in your room all day actually it's still only 7:00am you probably just had a bad dream"
