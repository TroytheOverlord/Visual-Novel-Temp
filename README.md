# What If

**What If** is a narrative-driven visual novel built in Unity (C#). It explores themes of choice, consequence, and identity, offering players branching dialogue and immersive story segments.

## üéÆ Overview

This project blends visual novel storytelling with light exploratory gameplay elements. Players engage in dialogue sequences where their choices influence pacing and tone, while background transitions, character movement, and layered sprites create a cinematic presentation.

The goal of *What If* is to experiment with interactive narrative systems, developing tools and structures that can be expanded into a full-scale story-driven game.
