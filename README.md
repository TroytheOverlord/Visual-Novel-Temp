What If

What If is a narrative-driven visual novel prototype built in Unity (C#). It explores themes of choice, consequence, and identity, giving players branching dialogue and immersive story segments presented with layered characters, backgrounds, and dynamic transitions.

üéÆ Overview

The project blends visual novel storytelling with light exploratory gameplay elements. Players engage in dialogue sequences where their choices influence pacing and tone, while background transitions, character movement, and layered sprites create a cinematic presentation.

The goal of What If is to experiment with interactive narrative systems, developing tools and structures that can be expanded into a full-scale story-driven game.
